Q1. Compare performance of MLP trained on MNIST dataset against RF and Logistic Regression model.
Ans: The F1-score using Random Forest is 96%, F1-score using Logistic Regression is 89%, F1-score using 
     MLP is 95%.

Q2. Contrast this with the t-SNE for the same layer but for an untrained model. What do you conclude?
Ans: The trained model's t-SNE visualization is expected to show more separated and distinct clusters 
     for different digits compared to the untrained model.

Q3. What all digits are commonly confused?
Ans: 5 is most commomly confused among all
